## Basic Interface

Base URL: “...”

#### Request

Uses HTTPS POST & JSON.

| name       | type          |
| ---        | ---           |
| session_id | string / null |

session_id should be generated by secure pseudorandom number generator.

#### Response

Uses JSON.

| name   | type          |
| ---    | ---           |
| action | string / null |
| data   | {...}         |

If action == 0, the data field is normal response.

Else, the corresponding action handler (typically an error handler) should be triggered, and the data field is the handler's required information.
